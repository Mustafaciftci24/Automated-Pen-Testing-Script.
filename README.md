# Automated-Pen-Testing-Script
This Bash script provides some useful automation for common tasks during a penetration testing exercise, namely creating a directory, running Nmap scans, and running gobuster on an endpoint URL. The functions are invoked using command line arguments, and the results are saved to files in a specified directory.
